Welcome to Climate Action Today. This is a website to organize activism to ensure future generations have a welcoming, safe planet to call home. As many have said, there is no planet B. 

This repository is being created as an open source repository to welcome contributions from people generally. 

More additions to come to this README, but for now, I need to get it live.

  ## Welcome to GitHub Pages

  You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/climateactiontoday/climateactiontoday.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

  Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

  ### Markdown

  ```markdown

  ### Jekyll Themes

  Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/climateactiontoday/climateactiontoday.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
